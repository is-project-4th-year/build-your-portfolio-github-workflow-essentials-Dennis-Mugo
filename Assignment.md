## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.

**Committing:** Enabled me to track each significant change I made, like updating content or fixing layout issues. This created a clear timeline of edits and made it easy to revert if something broke.

**Push and Pull:** Allowed me to sync my local code with the remote GitHub repository, ensuring I had a backup and that collaborators or my live deployment always had the latest version.

**Pull Requests:** Allowed me to review and approve changes before merging them into the main project. This helped maintain code quality and gave me a chance to test features first.

**Project Boards:** Gave me a visual overview of the work progress using columns like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” It made organizing tasks and tracking completion much easier.
